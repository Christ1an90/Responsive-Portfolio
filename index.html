                 My name is Christian Hill. I am currently a student at UNH in the coding bootcamp 6 month course. My educational 

                 background prior to now includes a bachelor's degree in Psychology which I obtained from Granite State College back in 2012 

                 I also have a few semesters torwards a Master's in Clinical Mental Health Couseling that I completed at New England College 
                 
                 in Henniker NH. Outside of school, I am an avid hiker. I have hiked dozens of 4,000 footers in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. 

                 I have a history of traveling 'adventures'. I spent a couple monthes living in Thailand training kickboxing a few years ago, martial arts 

                 being a passion of mine. I love motorcycles too. I have ridden back and forth across the country on one, and actually shipped my bike out to 

                 and lived on the Big Island of Hawaii for about a year before coming back to New England. My goal as of now is to learn everything that I can 

                 about web development thru this coding bootcamp I am currently enrolled in and begin a professional career utilizing this newly leanred skillset. 

                 I look forward to my future in this exciting new field and am very motivated to make the most out of this intensive 'bootcamp'. My email Address 
                 
                 is christiansean1990@gmail.com. I am currently not on social media, but this apt to change in the near future as I begin my job search.
